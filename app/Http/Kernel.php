             * Just adding the session middleware to your API routes is not not the solution. Itâ€™s omitted for a reason:
             * API routes should be stateless (i.e. not rely on state between the server and the client). This includes
             * sessions and cookies.
             *
             * @Comment
             * The issue is that in \Laravel\Sanctum\Http\Middleware\EnsureFrontendRequestsAreStateful, the actions for
             * this middleware are only applied if the function fromFrontend() returns true.
             *
             * To solve this issue, simply investigate and understand why fromFrontend()returns false in your case, and
             * rectify this.
